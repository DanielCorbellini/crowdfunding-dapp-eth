# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

Compile contracts

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

Run tests

```shell
npx hardhat test
# or
npm run test
```
